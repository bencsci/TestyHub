## fib

Write a function _fib_ that takes in a number argument, _n_, and returns the _n_-th number of the Fibonacci sequence.

The 0-th number of the sequence is 0.

The 1-st number of the sequence is 1.

To generate further numbers of the sequence, calculate the sum of previous two numbers.

Solve this recursively.

#### test_00:
```python
fib(0); # -> 0
```

#### test_01:
```python
fib(1); # -> 1
```

#### test_02:
```python
fib(2); # -> 1
```

#### test_03:
```python
fib(3); # -> 2
```

#### test_04:
```python
fib(4); # -> 3
```

#### test_05:
```python
fib(5); # -> 5
```

#### test_06:
```python
fib(35); # -> 9227465
```

#### test_07:

```python
fib(46); # -> 1836311903
